A simple python program to Encrypt and Decrypt Message base on Encryption key given.

There are two encryption/decryption algorithms available:
Shift -> it shifts each letter by the specified number (the key) according to its order in the alphabet in circle;
Unicode -> performs encryption/decryption based on the Unicode table.

Encrypted:
For the first stage, you need to manually encrypt the message "we found a treasure!" and print only the ciphertext (in lower case). To encrypt the message, replace each letter with the letter that is in the corresponding position from the end of the English alphabet

 Knowledge is key
 Write a program that reads an English message and an integer number (key) from the standard input and shifts each letter by the specified number according to its order in the alphabet. If you reach the end of the alphabet, start back at the beginning (a follows z).

The English alphabet is below:

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

Decrypted:
Modify the previous program to work with command-line arguments instead of the standard input. The program must parse three arguments: -mode, -key and -data. The first argument should determine the programâ€™s mode (enc - encryption, dec - decryption). The second argument is an integer key to modify the message, and the third argument is a text or ciphertext within quotes to encrypt or decrypt.
